# ThemisBending
A project using the Themis and ProjectKorra APIs in order to make them compatible.\

It will work better then disabling the movement checks of [Themis](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/themis-anti-cheat-1-16-x-bedrock-support-paper-tuinity-compatibility-free-optimized.90766/) completely, but it is still not optimal.
