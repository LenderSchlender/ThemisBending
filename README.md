# ThemisBending
A project using the Themis and ProjectKorra APIs in order to make them compatible. It also adds a GUI which displays the violations of each player, ordered by violation count.

It will work better than disabling the movement checks of [Themis](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/themis-anti-cheat-1-16-x-bedrock-support-paper-tuinity-compatibility-free-optimized.90766/) completely, but there might be still some bugs.
If you encounter any bugs/false reports while bending, please let me know by either opening an issue, or on [the Themis discord (LenderSchlender#2378)](https://discord.gg/2tzKFDJ2wW).
